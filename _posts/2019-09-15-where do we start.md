The two most important tools which I have been using in my accounting-related programming work 
are [Python](https://www.python.org){:target="_blank"} and [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.jupyter.org){:target="_blank"}. 
Both of these are the foundational tools of data analytics, data science and scientific analysis.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages and Jupyter Notebook is 
an environment that can run your python code online. Both have low thresholds of entry and are very powerful.

The hardest thing about getting started is making sure your environment is set up correctly, especially if you are looking to run your Jupyter Notebook locally. However, there are many websites and in browser options making it significantly easier. 

### Running Jupyter in The Cloud – Easy Option - No Installations Required
