Python is the fastest-growing programming language and the second most loved, according to [Stackoverflow Developer Survey from 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019){:target="_blank"}.

For me, the two most important tools in my accounting-related programming work 
are [Python](https://www.python.org){:target="_blank"} and [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.jupyter.org){:target="_blank"}. 
 Both of these are the foundational tools of data analytics, data science and scientific analysis.
[Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/){:target="_blank"} is one of the most popular programming languages and Jupyter Notebook is 
an environment that can run your python code online. Both have low thresholds of entry and are very powerful.

The hardest thing about getting started is making sure your environment is set up correctly, especially if you are looking to run your Jupyter Notebook locally. However, there are many websites and in browser options making it significantly easier. 

### Running Jupyter in The Cloud – Easy Option - No Installations Required
1.  Google Colab - In your browser open [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#scrollTo=wRH3FBu-Hqau){:target="_blank"}
    * Colaboratory is a Jupyter environment running entirely in your browser
    * It is free and allows you to store your `.ipynb` (Jupyter) files in your Drive or GitHub
    * You can upload existing notebooks under File > Upload

2.  Azure Notebooks – In your browser open [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/#){:target="_blank"}
    * Runs in your browser
    * It is free for students
    * You can upload existing notebooks once you create a project under My Projects > Upload (next to New)
    * `Here` is my project in the screenshot below

### Running Jupyter on Your Computer

To run Jupyter on your computer, you will need to locate your `Terminal` on Mac 
or `Command Prompt` on Windows machine first. Then you'll need:
1. Python
    * Mac
        + Mac has Python pre-installed. There is no need to download
        + [Anaconda for Mac Download Tutorial](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
    * Windows
        + [Microsoft Python Download Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners){:target="_blank"}
        + [Windows Anaconda Python Download Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuXIHZgBKoI){:target="_blank"}
2. Jupyter Notebook
    * If you downloaded Anaconda, then Python, Jupyter Notebook and other scientific packages are bundled in together with that download. No need to install Jupyter. 
    * [Installing Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html){:target="_blank"}
    * [Running Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running){:target="_blank"}
3. Text Editor 
    * I currently use [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3){:target="_blank"} on Mac
    * Windows users - [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/){:target="_blank"}
