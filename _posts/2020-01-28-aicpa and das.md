In 2018 AICPA committed to [Dynamic Audit Solution (DAS) initiative](https://www.aicpa.org/press/pressreleases/2018/aicpa-leading-cpa-firms-commit-to-dynamic-audit-solution-initiative.html?cid=referral:article:AICPAInsightsDASblog:pressrelease:aicpa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=article&utm_campaign=AICPAInsightsDASblog&utm_content=pressrelease){:target="_blank"} and they are ready to deliver.

### <i class="fa fa-wind"></i> What is DAS?
> DAS is a partnership among the AICPA, CPA.com, leading CPA firms and our technology partner, CaseWare International, to develop a data-driven, technology-enabled audit solution that will enhance the efficiency, quality and value of audits.

Simply put it's an application developed on the CaseWare Cloud platform that will employ data analytics and machine learning to analyze data across all phases of audit. 

This initiative has been executed swiftly and so far with great success.

I do wonder whether this platform will allow implementation of continuous auditing model.
