Here is part one of cleaning [financial_sample.csv](/assets/files/financial_sample.csv){:target="_blank"} with `Python` `pandas` package.

### <i class="fa fa-wind"></i> `pandas`

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html){:target="_blank"} is a fantastic and powerful package.

> Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

### <i class="fa fa-wind"></i> Let's clean it!

I am starting this introduction to `Jupyter Notebook` and `pandas` with a data cleaning tutorial simply because working with data is 90% cleaning and 10% analyzing. Cleaning data is also the most frustrating and most time consuming aspect of working with data.
The sample financial data csv file that I am using here is borrowed from this [Microsoft
tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/sample-financial-download){:target="_blank"} plus about 20,000 additional rows of data.

### <i class="fa fa-wind"></i> To get started:

* Download [financial_sample.csv](/assets/files/financial_sample.csv){:target="_blank"}
* Also, download [python_pandas_cleaning_data1.ipynb](/assets/files/python_pandas_cleaning_data1.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
* Make sure both are saved in the same folder on your computer
* Then proceed to [Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb){:target="_blank"} and under `File` > `Upload notebook`. After the new notebook is uploaded, there will be a `File` icon on the left side of the screen. By clicking on it, you will be able to upload the csv file. It is only uploaded for the duration of your runtime/session on Colab. You can also upload both the notebook and csv file to your Google Drive and access them both through Colab. For the brave newbie, there is also `GitHub`
* Once you have both files up and running on Colab, you can start going through it
* For a quick intro you can visit [`intro_to_pandas` from Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

Your screen should look like this screenshot below, once you have [python_pandas_cleaning_data1.ipynb](/assets/files/python_pandas_cleaning_data1.ipynb){:target="_blank"} uploaded to Colab.
