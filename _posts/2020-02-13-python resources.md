### <i class="fa fa-wind"></i> Overabundance

There is an overabundance of online Python resources which might make it even more intimidating to get started. 
But here are a few top choices that I tend to go back to on regular basis. These are some online books, screencasts and Edx course which I found helpful.
* Most important resource of them all - [Python Docs](https://www.python.org/doc/){:target="_blank"}
* My all-time favorite. I always find my answers here or Stack Overflow - [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage){:target="_blank"}
* I tend to go back to this book all the time. `Practical Programming for Total Beginners` - [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc){:target="_blank"}
* Fantastic resource. It covers all you need to know and some - [Dive Into Python 3](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/){:target="_blank"}
* These are very useful - [Python Screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgoYPTU6ljCEggReCMF0m0760QTot9Qz){:target="_blank"}
* This is for the brave beginner's out there - [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7?utm_medium=affiliate_partner&utm_source=ocwprod-mit-opencourseware?utm_source=OCW&utm_medium=CHP&utm_campaign=OCW){:target="_blank"}
