<h1 class="index-header">changing nature of accounting</h1>
<section class="index-p">
    <p>Accounting is changing rapidly with the new developments in technology, automation, data analytics, machine learning, natural language processing, even OCR/optical character recognition - all of it under one very powerful umbrella of digital innovation. A lot of the changes are still widely misunderstood and cautiously pursued. I would like to use this blog as a means of allowing a small glimpse into what's possible, the challenges behind it and how programming can influence accounting.</p>
